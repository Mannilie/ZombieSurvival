Zombie Survival was a game project that I worked on during my time studying at AIE. The game was a submisson to my first assignment where I had to work in team of artists for the first time.

The game's art style incorporates the traditional 'pixel art' style inspired by Halfbrick's Age of Zombies which consists of the same type of graphics.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate and recreate a common mechanic in most zombie/monster survival games where the player is given weapon(s) in which they must use to their advantage to defend themselves from hordes of rogue-like creatures.

Zombie Survival was a successful project in achieving the final goal because the game was able to run extremely well on PC with very minimal latency whilst providing the player with the same nightmarish experience achieved in most 2D top-down survival/horror games.
